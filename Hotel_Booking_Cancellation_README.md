A chain of hotels, INN Hotels Group, is facing a problem of inventory loss due to booking cancellations, resulting in revenue loss. 
They want to build an Data Science solution that will help them predict the likelihood of a booking getting cancelled so that they can take measures to fill in potential vacancies.
Hotel booking cancellations becomes a crucial problem to solve as it leads to revenue loss and operational inefficiencies. The cancellation of bookings impacts a hotel on various fronts:
1. Loss of revenue when the hotel cannot resell the room
2. Additional costs of distribution channels by increasing commissions or paying for publicity to help sell these rooms
3. Lowering prices last minute, so the hotel can resell a room, resulting in reduced profit margins
In the current context, inventory refers to a hotel room, and the inability to sell one leads to inventory loss.
